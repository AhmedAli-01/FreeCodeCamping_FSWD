      <!--This is an HTML comment.-->

      <h2>Common HTML elements</h2>
      <strong> Heading Elements: </strong>There are six heading elements in
      HTML. The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the
      importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the
      importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h1>most important heading element</h1>
        </li>
        <li><h2>second most important heading element</h2></li>
        <li><h3>third most important heading element</h3></li>
        <li><h4>fourth most important heading element</h4></li>
        <li><h5>fifth most important heading element</h5></li>
        <li><h6>least important heading element</h6></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Special Characters and Linking</h2>
      <p>
        HTML entities: An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of
        characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML. Examples
        include the ampersand (&amp;) symbol and the less than symbol (&lt;).
      </p>
      <p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>
