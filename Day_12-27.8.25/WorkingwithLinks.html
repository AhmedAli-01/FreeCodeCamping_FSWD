        What Are the Different Target Attribute Types, and How Do They Work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may have seen the target attribute on anchor elements, or links.
        This important attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for the
        anchor element:

      <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
      <h2>What Is the Difference Between Absolute and Relative Paths?</h2>
      <p>
        A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in
        a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to
        resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages. There
        are absolute and relative paths - both are essential when specifying
        file locations within a file system.
