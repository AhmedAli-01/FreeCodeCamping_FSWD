      <h1>Working with Links</h1>
      <p>
        In these lectures, you will learn about links, the target attribute,
        different link states, absolute, and relative paths, and more.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What Are the Different Target Attribute Types, and How Do They Work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may have seen the target attribute on anchor elements, or links.
        This important attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for the
        anchor element:
      </p>
      <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit freeCodeCamp</a>
      <h2>What Is the Difference Between Absolute and Relative Paths?</h2>
      <p>
        A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in
        a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to
        resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages. There
        are absolute and relative paths - both are essential when specifying
        file locations within a file system.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What Is the Difference Between Slashes, a Single Dot, and Double Dot in
        Path Syntax?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may have seen links like /public/logo.png, ./script.js, or
        ../styles.css before. But what do these special types of links mean?
        These are called file paths. There are three key syntaxes to know. First
        is the slash, which can be a backslash (\) or forward slash (/)
        depending on your operating system. The second is the single dot (.).
        And finally, we have the double dot (..). The slash is known as the
        "path separator". It is used to indicate a break in the text between
        folder or file names. This is how your computer knows that naomis-files/
        points to a directory of that same name, while naomis/files/ points to a
        files directory in the naomis directory. A single dot points to the
        current directory, and two dots point to the parent directory.
