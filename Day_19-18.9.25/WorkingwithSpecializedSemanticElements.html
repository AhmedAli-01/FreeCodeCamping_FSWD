        In this lecture, you will learn about specialized semantic elements like
        u, s, code elements and more.

        How Do You Display Mathematical Equations and Chemical Formulas in HTML?

      <p>
        The superscript element is used to display a piece of text as a
        superscript. A superscript is a symbol or letter printed above the
        normal line of text. Here is an example using the superscript element to
        illustrate exponents:
      </p>
      <p>2<sup>2</sup> (2 squared) is 4.</p>
      <p>4<sup>3</sup> (4 to the power of 3) is ....</p>
      <p>
        This is another example of how it is used: Monseigneur is often written
        as <strong>M<sup>gr</sup></strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example of using the subscript element to show the chemical
        representation for carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p>CO<sub>2</sub></p>
      <p>
        Common use cases for the subscript element include chemical formulas,
        footnotes, and variable subscripts.
