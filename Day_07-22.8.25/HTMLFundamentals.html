        This is inside a div, just for practice purposes. it does have a
        semantic unlike div.

        his is because the section element has semantic meaning. Semantics are
        the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a
        language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means
        if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic
        meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops,
        mobiles, you name it.
