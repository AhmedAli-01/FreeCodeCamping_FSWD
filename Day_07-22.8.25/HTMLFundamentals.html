      <h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
        In these lectures, you will learn about HTML fundamentals like the div
        element, the id and class attributes, the HTML boilerplate, HTML
        entities, and more.

        This is inside a div, just for practice purposes. it does have a
        semantic unlike div.

        his is because the section element has semantic meaning. Semantics are
        the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a
        language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means
        if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic
        meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops,
        mobiles, you name it.

    <h2>What Are HTML Entities, and What Are Some Common Examples?</h2>
    <p>
      An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to
      represent a reserved character in HTML. In this example, there is a
      paragraph element with an image element nested inside:
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>
      What Is the Role of the Script Element in HTML, and How Can It Be Used to
      Link to External JavaScript Files?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The script element is used to embed executable code. Most developers will
      use this to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is used to add
      interactivity to your web pages. Common examples of using JavaScript
      include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate
      user input in real-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <script>
        alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
      </script>
    </p>
    <p>
      The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external
      JavaScript file. src stands for "source". The reason why it is not
      encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document is
      because of separation of concerns. Separation of concerns is a design
      principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have
      each section address a separate concern. In this case, we want to separate
      our JavaScript code from our HTML code.
