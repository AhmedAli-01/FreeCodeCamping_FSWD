      <h1>How Do You Display Abbreviations and Acronyms in HTML?</h1>
      <p>
        An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word. For example, "Dr"
        followed by a period, is an abbreviation for the word "doctor". An
        acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of a phrase, with each
        letter representing the first letter of a word in that phrase. HTML is
        an example of an acronym. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. By
        taking the first letters of each word H, T, M, and L, you get the
        acronym HTML. They are both very helpful for writing more concise text,
        especially when they are well-known and easy to understand in a given
        context. If you need to display abbreviations and acronyms in HTML, the
        abbreviation element is exactly what you're looking for. You should
        always explain their full meaning when you use them for the first time.
        Then you can use the abbreviation element to highlight them and provide
        more details. Here's an example where you can see a paragraph with the
        sentence HTML is the foundation of the web:
      </p>
      <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
