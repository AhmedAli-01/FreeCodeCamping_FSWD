    <h2>What Are Replaced Elements, and What Are Some Examples?</h2>
    <p>
      A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an
      external resource rather than by CSS itself. CSS, or cascading
      stylesheets, is used to add styles to a web page. Common examples of
      replaced elements include the image, iframe, and video elements. With
      replaced elements, you can control the position, or layout of an element.
      But your CSS cannot directly modify the content of that element. This
      might be easier to explain with some examples. Consider the image element,
      which embeds an image on your web page.
