    <h1>Working with the iframe Element</h1>
    <p>
      In these lectures, you will learn how to work with the iframe element
      which is used to embed an external site on your web page.
    </p>
    <h2>What Are Replaced Elements, and What Are Some Examples?</h2>
    <p>
      A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an
      external resource rather than by CSS itself. CSS, or cascading
      stylesheets, is used to add styles to a web page. Common examples of
      replaced elements include the image, iframe, and video elements. With
      replaced elements, you can control the position, or layout of an element.
      But your CSS cannot directly modify the content of that element. This
      might be easier to explain with some examples. Consider the image element,
      which embeds an image on your web page.

    <h2>How Do You Embed Videos onto Your Page Using the iframe Element?</h2>
    <p>
      First, what exactly is the iframe element? iframe stands for inline frame.
      It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within
      the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML
      element, or even other web pages. Here's what the syntax of the iframe
      element looks like:
    </p>
    <iframe
      src="video-url"
      width="width-value"
      height="height-value"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      To embed a video within an iframe you can copy it directly from popular
      video services like YouTube and Vimeo, or define it yourself with the src
      attribute pointing to the URL of that video. Here's an example of
      embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube:
    </p>
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
      title="YouTube video player"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      You can then customize the iframe to your needs or even define your own by
      copying the link to the YouTube video and pasting it in as the URL value.
      The caveat is that you must replace https://youtu.be with
      https://youtube.com/embed/. youtu.be is the domain when you copy the share
      link and youtube.com/embed/ is the domain required for embedding videos
      with the iframe element. Here's an example of that:
    </p>
    <iframe
      src="https://youtube.com/embed/gp5H0Vw39yw?si=Rb_2nDK6abv1iIAM"
      title="freeCodeCamp Typescript Course"
      width="500"
      height="285"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from
      video services like YouTube and Vimeo. Here's a video from Pixabay
      embedded with the iframe element:
    </p>
    <iframe
      src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/video/2022/07/24/125310-733046613_large.mp4"
      width="500"
      height="285"
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      Don't forget you can also embed a map, another web page, or direct HTML
      within the iframe element. Here's a map I was able to embed with the
      iframe element:
    </p>
    <h1>A Map from Openstreetmap.org Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

    <iframe
      width="425"
      height="350"
      src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=3.006134033203125%2C6.150112578753815%2C3.6357879638671875%2C6.749850810550778&amp;layer=mapnik"
      style="border: 1px solid black"
    >
    </iframe>
    <br />
    <small>
      <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/6.4501/3.3210">
        View Larger Map
      </a>
    </small>
    <p>
      If you want to embed direct HTML within the iframe element you have to use
      the srcdoc attribute instead of src.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
