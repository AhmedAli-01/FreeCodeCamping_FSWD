      In these lectures, you will learn how to work with SVGs and learn about
      techniques for optimizing your images.

        irst, you need to understand how images work. Common image formats like PNG and JPG are classified as raster formats. This essentially means that they are pixel-based, with the data tracking the color value in each pixel.

A large downside of raster based images is that they do not upscale well. If you've ever tried to make a PNG larger, you may have seen that it becomes pixelated, or blurry.

An SVG is a different kind of image. SVG stands for a scalable vector graphic. A vector graphic tracks data based on paths and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an SVG, can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality.

SVGs specifically have the added benefit of storing data in XML. This means you can use them directly in your code as raw HTML with the svg element. It also means you can programmatically change the color of the image.
