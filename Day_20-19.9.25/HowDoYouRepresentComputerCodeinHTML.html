      <h1>How Do You Represent Computer Code in HTML?</h1>
      <p>
        The inline code element is used to represent short snippets of code
        inside text. Common use cases for the code element would be for
        technical articles and documentation pages. Here is an example of using
        the code element to show a CSS code snippet:
      </p>
      <p>
        To set the text color to bule in CSS, use the following code:
        <code>color: blue;</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, the CSS color property is used to set the text color to
        blue. By wrapping this code snippet inside <code> </code>tags, it
        communicates to the browser that the text is a piece of inline code. The
        browser will apply default styles for content inside of the code
        element. The default styling is a monospaced font. The code element is
        meant to represent a single line of code. If you want to represent
        multiple lines of code, you will need to place a code element inside a
        preformatted text element. The preformatted text element is used to
        represent preformatted text. Here is an example of using the
        preformatted text element to show a CSS declaration:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <code>
    body {
      color: red;
    }
  </code>
</pre>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
