      What Are the Roles of the HTML Audio and Video Elements, and How Do They
      Work?
    </h1>
    <p>
      The audio and video elements allow you to add sound and video content to
      your HTML documents. The audio element supports popular audio formats like
      mp3, wav, and ogg. The video element supports mp4, ogg, and webm formats.
      To include audio content on your web page, you can use the audio element
      with the src attribute pointing to the location of your audio file:
    </p>
    <audio src="timeneverheals.mp3" controls></audio>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Apart from the src and controls attributes, there are several other
      attributes that enhance the functionality of the audio element. The loop
      attribute is a boolean attribute that makes the audio replay continuously.
      Here's an example of using the loop attribute to play one of Quincy
      Larson's songs titled "Can't stay down":
    </p>
    <audio
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"
      loop
      controls
    ></audio>
    <h2>Video Section</h2>
    <p>
      All the attributes we have learned so far are also supported in the video
      element. Here's an example of using a video element with the loop,
      controls, and muted attributes:
    </p>
    <video
      src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
      loop
      controls
      muted
