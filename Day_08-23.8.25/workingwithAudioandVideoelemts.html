      What Are the Roles of the HTML Audio and Video Elements, and How Do They
      Work?
    </h1>
    <p>
      The audio and video elements allow you to add sound and video content to
      your HTML documents. The audio element supports popular audio formats like
      mp3, wav, and ogg. The video element supports mp4, ogg, and webm formats.
      To include audio content on your web page, you can use the audio element
      with the src attribute pointing to the location of your audio file:
    </p>
    <audio src="timeneverheals.mp3" controls></audio>
  </body>
</html>
