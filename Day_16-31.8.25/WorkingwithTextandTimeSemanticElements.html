      <h1>Working with Text and Time Semantic Elements</h1>
      <h2>How Do Block and Inline Quotes Work in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        n HTML, quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted text from the
        surrounding content. This gives the quoted text a format that is easy to
        identify. You should use the block quotation element for representing a
        section quoted from another source. It's mainly used for extended
        quotations. If the source of the quote has an address, you can cite it
        with the cite attribute. The value of this attribute should be a valid
        URL.

      <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To
        have built software systems that people rely upon?"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you want to start and end the block quote with quotation marks, you
        may need to write them explicitly within the text. You can write the
        text directly within the block quotation element, like I just did, or
        wrap it within one or more paragraph elements. This is helpful when the
        text has multiple paragraphs, but you want to keep them within the same
        block quote. Here's an example with four paragraphs:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        <p>
          Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for
          your friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes
          around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.
        </p>
        <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
        <p>
          You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made
          a move.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you want to attribute the source visually, you can add a citation
        element, cite, outside of the block quotation element. This is different
        from the cite attribute. The citation element is an HTML element that
        you can use to mark up the title of a referenced creative work like a
        book article, song, film, website, or research paper. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <div>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/"
        >
          Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To
          have built software systems that people rely upon?
