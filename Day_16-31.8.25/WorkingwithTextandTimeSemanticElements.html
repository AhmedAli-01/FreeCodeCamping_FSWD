      <h2>How Do Block and Inline Quotes Work in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        n HTML, quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted text from the
        surrounding content. This gives the quoted text a format that is easy to
        identify. You should use the block quotation element for representing a
        section quoted from another source. It's mainly used for extended
        quotations. If the source of the quote has an address, you can cite it
        with the cite attribute. The value of this attribute should be a valid
        URL.
