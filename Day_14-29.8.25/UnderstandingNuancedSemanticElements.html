      <h1>Understanding Nuanced Semantic Elements</h1>
      <p>
        In these lectures, you will learn when you should use certain semantic
        elements like the em element over the i element, description lists, and
        more.
      </p>
      <h2>
        When Should You Use the Emphasis Element Over the Idiomatic Text
        Element?
      </h2>
      <p>
        These elements are very closely related to the concepts of
        presentational and semantic HTML. The idiomatic text element, i, was
        originally used for presentational purposes to display the text in
        italics. But now, it is frequently used for highlighting alternative
        voice or mood, idiomatic terms from another language, technical terms,
        and thoughts.

      <h2>
        When Should You Use the Strong Element Over the Bring Attention To
        Element?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The "bring attention to" element, b, is commonly used to highlight
        keywords in summaries, or product names in reviews. Usually, browsers
        display this text in boldface. Here's an example using the b element to
        highlight product names in this review:
      </p>
      <p>
        We tested several products, including the <b>SuperSound 3000</b> for
        audio quality, the <b>QuickCharge Pro</b> for fast charging, and the
        <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> for cleaning. The first two performed well, but
        the <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> did not meet expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser renders these parts of the text as bold text. This visual
        emphasis will draw readers attention to the product names. If you need
        to emphasize the importance of the text, you should use the strong
        element instead of the b element. strong is a semantic HTML element that
        emphasizes text that is crucial, or urgent. This is an example where the
        strong element is used to label a very important warning about the
        potential allergic reactions that customers may have to a product:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> This product may cause allergic reactions.
      </p>
