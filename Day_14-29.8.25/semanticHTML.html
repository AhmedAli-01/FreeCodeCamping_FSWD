      <h1>Importance of Semantic HTML</h1>
      <p>
        In these lectures, you will learn about semantic HTML and why you should
        care about it, semantic elements, how semantic HTML differs from
        presentational HTML, and more.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Should You Care About Semantic HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Semantics are the meaning of words, or phrases, in a language. In HTML,
        which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. In
        fact, you can think of your HTML document like you would a text
        document. And much like a text document, you might have headings,
        images, bold text, and other formatting. The semantic meaning of an
        element refers to what special information that element conveys.

      <h2>Why is it Important to Have Good Structural Hierarchy?</h2>
      <p>
        The most important aspect of creating a structural hierarchy is the
        proper use of heading elements. Heading elements are numbered as h1, h2,
        h3, and so on. These numbers represent the heading level for that
        element. Much like a text document, you do not want to use heading
        levels in the incorrect order. Your h1 element is your top-level
        heading. You will rarely have more than one of these on a page, and it
        should typically come before all of your content. Your h2 element is
        your subheading. It should always come after your h1 and might come
        after some introductory text. Unlike an h1 element, you can have
        multiple h2 elements on your page. You'll often do this to delineate
        different sections of content. Following the pattern, your h3 element
        should always come after an h2 element. That is, you should never skip
        directly from h1 to h3. You can, however, have multiple heading elements
        at the same level.

      <h2>What Is the Difference Between Presentational and Semantic HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Presentational HTML focuses on the appearance and style of the content.
        In the early days of HTML, developers would use elements like the
        center, big, and font elements. But in modern web development you
        shouldn't use these types of elements, because of their limitations and
        negative impact on accessibility and maintainability. Many
        presentational HTML elements are deprecated, which means that they are
        outdated and no longer recommended. There are better ways to get the
        same results. However, it is helpful to know that they exist, so we'll
        take a look at some examples. The font element is a deprecated element
        used to set the font size and color of the text.
